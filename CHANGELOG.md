## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Package skeleton: Composer manifest, PSR-4 autoloading (`Ephraitech\Forms\` → `src/`),
  PHPUnit configuration on the CodeIgniter 4 test bootstrap, and environment smoke tests.
- `Config\Forms`: theme registry (Bootstrap 5 by default) with view paths, CSS classes and
  required-field marker; behaviour switches for CSRF, method spoofing, `novalidate`,
  rule-derived HTML attributes, error summary, old input, id prefixing, string trimming,
  empty-to-null conversion and unchecked checkbox values.
- `Exceptions\FormException` for configuration and definition errors.
- Field layer: `Contracts\FieldInterface`, base `Fields\Field` (fluent setters, rules with
  custom messages, safe attribute handling, CSS classes, help text, ids prefixed by form name,
  required detection, rule-derived HTML attributes, value normalisation, chaining back to the
  parent form) and field types `Text`, `Email`, `Password`, `Number`, `Tel`, `Url`, `Date`,
  `Hidden`, `Textarea`, `Select` (with option groups), `Radio`, `Checkbox` and `Submit`.
- Lazy, cached option closures for `Select` and `Radio`.
- `Support\RuleParser` for bracket-aware splitting and reading of CodeIgniter rule strings.
- `Form` class: class-based forms via `define()` and inline forms via `Form::make()` with
  `end()`; names derived from class names; action, method (with PUT/PATCH/DELETE spoofing),
  id, classes, attributes and multipart settings; typed builders for every field type plus
  `add()` for custom fields; `remove()`, `has()`, `getField()`, `getSubmittableFields()`;
  `fill()` from arrays, Entities and objects; value resolution in priority order (submitted,
  old input, filled, default) with correct unticked-checkbox and password handling; old input
  scoped to the form that produced it via a hidden `_form` key.
